# Introduction

In this analysis, I will explore clinical and demographic data from the TCGA-CESC project. 

**My primary research question** is to investigate whether there are differences in clinical and demographic characteristics of cervical cancer by histologic subtype.

**The intended audience** for this analysis is researchers and clinicians interested in cervical cancer.

# Data Source & Dictionary

The data used in this analysis can be accessed from the [TCGA-CESC data portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-CESC). I will be working with clinical and demographic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamouse Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Collection(TCGA-CESC).

The data dictionary can be accessed [here](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-entity-list&anchor=clinical).

# Load Required Libraries & TCGA Data

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

clinical <- GDCquery_clinic(project = "TCGA-CESC", type = "clinical")
```

# Data Cleaning
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
clinical <- clinical %>%
  mutate(primary_diagnosis_recode = case_when(
    primary_diagnosis %in% c(
      "Squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, NOS",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma, NOS",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma, large cell, nonkeratinizing, NOS",
      "Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Papillary squamous cell carcinoma"
    ) ~ "Squamous Cell Carcinoma",
    
    primary_diagnosis %in% c(
      "Adenocarcinoma, endocervical type",
      "Adenocarcinoma, NOS", 
      "Adenosquamous carcinoma",
      "Mucinous adenocarcinoma, endocervical type",
      "Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, NOS"
    ) ~ "Adenocarcinoma",
    
    TRUE ~ NA_character_ 
  ))
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Due to small case counts, cases of adenosquamous carcinoma have been grouped with adenocarcinoma cases.

# Analysis #1 
**Are there differences in age at diagnosis by histologic subtype?**
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(clinical, aes(x = primary_diagnosis_recode, y = age_at_index, fill = primary_diagnosis_recode)) +
    geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) + 
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, color = "black", outlier.shape = NA) +   
    labs(title = "Age at Diagnosis by Histologic Subtype",
         x = "Histologic Subtype",

    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")

# Analysis #2
**Are there differences in FIGO stage at diagnosis by histologic subtype?**
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
clinical <- clinical %>%
    mutate(figo_stage_recode = case_when(
        figo_stage %in% c("Stage IA", "Stage IA1", "Stage IA2", "Stage IB", "Stage IB1", "Stage IB2") ~ "Stage I",

        figo_stage %in% c("Stage IVA", "Stage IVB") ~ "Stage IV",
        TRUE ~ NA_character_ 
    ))

clinical <- clinical %>%
    mutate(figo_stage_recode = factor(figo_stage_recode, levels = c("Stage I", "Stage II", "Stage III", "Stage IV")))
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
red_palette <- c("Stage I" = "#ffcccc",   # Light red for Stage I
                 "Stage II" = "#ff9999",  # Medium light red for Stage II

                 "Stage IV" = "#ff3333")  # Dark red for Stage IV

ggplot(clinical, aes(x = primary_diagnosis_recode, fill = figo_stage_recode)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
    labs(title = "FIGO Stage Distribution by Histologic Subtype",

    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face="bold")
    )
```

# Analysis #3
**Are there differences across FIGO stages in terms of age at diagnosis by histologic subtype?
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(clinical %>% 
           filter(!is.na(age_at_index), !is.na(figo_stage_recode)), 
       aes(x = figo_stage_recode, y = age_at_index, fill = primary_diagnosis_recode)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA) +  
    labs(title = "Age at Diagnosis by FIGO Stage and Histologic Subtype",
         x = "FIGO Stage",
         y = "Age at Diagnosis",
         fill = "Histologic Subtype",
         subtitle = "Box Plots of Age at Diagnosis for Each FIGO Stage and Subtype",
         caption = "Data from TCGA-CESC") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, face = "bold"))
```

# A look at the literature
**How does stage at diagnosis and histologic subtype impact survival, stratified by race and ethnicity?**

**Five year relative survival stratified by race, stage at diagnosis and histologic subtype**
